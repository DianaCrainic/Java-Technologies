# [JavaServer Faces Lab3](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/tj/labs/lab_03.html)

Create a Web application using JavaServer Faces technology, dedicated to exam scheduling.
There is a set of exams that must be scheduled in a session (a number of consecutive days). There is a set of students and each student must attend a list of exams. A student can participate to at most one exam in the same day.

Tasks Done:
- a web page for defining the **exams** - create an exam and view list of exams;
- a web page for defining the **students** - create a student and view list of students;
- relational database and JDBC in order to store and retrieve data – **PostgreSQL**;
- non trivial **JSF component** -  data table for exams and students;
- **internationalize** the user interface and offer support for at least two locales – English and Romanian;
- Ajax-based JSF implementation – **PrimeFaces**;
- intuitive design and interactive app (calendar selector for exam date, convertor for saving information to database).
