# [JavaServer Faces Lab3](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/tj/labs/lab_03.html)

Create a Web application using JavaServer Faces technology, dedicated to exam scheduling.
There is a set of exams that must be scheduled in a session (a number of consecutive days). There is a set of students and each student must attend a list of exams. A student can participate to at most one exam in the same day.

Tasks Done:
- A Web page for defining the **exams**. Each exam has a name, a starting time and a duration.
- A Web page for defining the **students** that must attend the exams. Each student has a name and the list of exams.
Used a relational database and JDBC in order to store and retrieve data. (**PostgreSQL** was used).
Used at least one non trivial **JSF component**, for example a data table, a dialog, etc.
**Internationalized** the user interface and offer support for at least two locales (English and Romanian languages).
